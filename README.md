# Secure Electronic Voting System

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to implement encryption techniques to set up a secure electronic voting system for a multinational company. The system will have two separate authorities: one for identifying voters and another for counting votes. The goal is to enable the company's employees to vote remotely for a new manager at the company headquarters.

## System Architecture

The system will involve voters, two centers (CO and DE), and the use of public and private keys for encryption and decryption. The detailed architecture and the roles of each entity are described in the project statement.

## Development Roadmap

The development of this project will follow a roadmap that includes six main phases:

### 1. Planning and Design Phase

This phase involves defining the scope and requirements of the project, choosing a design pattern for the application, deciding on the database schema and model relationships, and planning the user authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### 2. Backend Development

The backend will be set up using Django and PostgreSQL. This phase involves defining Django models, implementing Django views and URL routing, implementing the RESTful API endpoints, and writing unit tests for the backend functionality.

### 3. Frontend Development

The frontend will be set up using React. This phase involves designing and implementing user interface components, configuring the frontend application to consume the RESTful API, and writing integration tests for the frontend components and interactions.

### 4. Dockerization

This phase involves writing Dockerfiles for both the backend and frontend applications, defining the environment variables and configurations for each service, and testing the application locally using Docker containers.

### 5. Deployment

The application will be deployed to a cloud platform or a hosting provider. This phase involves configuring the environment variables and database connection in the deployment environment, setting up automated build and deployment processes, and ensuring proper security configurations.

### 6. Monitoring and Maintenance

This phase involves configuring monitoring tools to detect errors, crashes, and performance issues, setting up alerts and notifications, regularly updating the application and its dependencies, and implementing backup and disaster recovery strategies.
