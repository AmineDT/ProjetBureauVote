# Secure Voting App

## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to provide a secure and reliable platform for voting. The app should allow users to vote on specific topics while ensuring that the voting process is secure and free from fraudulent activities.

## Microservices Architecture
The application will be designed using a microservices architecture, where different components of the app will be developed as independent services. This approach allows for better scalability, maintainability, and resilience of the system.

## Scalability
Scalability is a key requirement for the application, and the microservices architecture will help achieve this goal. The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users and a significant amount of data without compromising on performance.

## PostgreSQL Database
The application will use PostgreSQL as the database management system. PostgreSQL is a powerful and reliable open-source database that is well-suited for large-scale applications. It supports advanced features such as ACID compliance, high availability, and replication, which are essential for a secure and scalable voting app.

## Python Flask Backend
The backend of the application will be developed using Python Flask. Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework that allows developers to build web applications quickly and easily. It provides a range of tools and libraries that make it easy to build RESTful APIs and integrate with other technologies.

## React Frontend
The frontend of the application will be developed using React. React is a popular and widely used JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a rich set of components and tools that enable developers to create responsive, interactive, and visually appealing user interfaces quickly and easily.

By combining the microservices architecture, PostgreSQL database, Python Flask backend, and React frontend, we can develop a secure and scalable voting app that meets the requirements of modern voting systems.
